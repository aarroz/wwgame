# wwgame

Project wwgame is my attempt at making a 3D game using the Godot Engine.
Currently the project is focused on interactive player mechanics for a singleplayer experience.
The objective of this project is for me to make a base for interactable FPS games using Godot.
I hope to make a good game using this base that's a work in progress.

Stay Tuned,

Current objectives of the project
- Make the character motion flexible
- Make level building with assets easier
- Work on techniques to make physics more flexible
- Realistic Shaders (might be possible with Godot 3.0 coming later)
