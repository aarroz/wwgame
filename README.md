# wwgame

### Update: Project on hiatus until further notice. (2021/03/21)

Project wwgame is my attempt at making a 3D game using the Godot Engine.
Currently the project is focused on interactive player mechanics for a singleplayer experience.
The objective of this project is for me to make a base for interactable FPS games using Godot.
I hope to make a good game using this base that's a work in progress. Expect an experimental sandbox/puzzle game.

Version of Godot being used: 3.2.1 Stable

Current objectives of the project
