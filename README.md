# wwgame

Project wwgame is my attempt at making a 3D game using the Godot Engine.
Currently the project is focused on interactive player mechanics for a singleplayer experience.
The objective of this project is for me to make a base for interactable FPS games using Godot.
I hope to make a good game using this base that's a work in progress.

Version of Godot being used: 3.0 RC1

Stay Tuned,
